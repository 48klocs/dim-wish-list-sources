Making Custom Rolls
1. The default DIM WL is voltron &/or choosy voltron. 
		- (choosy has Thumbs-Down "Bad" Rolls added for fun, but is otherwise is the same so use that)
2. To make your own, make a text file & add the url of the weapon perk. 
		- Make then Copy URL from trackingnetwork.com->D2->Database->Weapons-><Select and customize weapon>
3. You can then add as many variations on that weapon as you want. 
		- Just paste all the URLs on separate lines.
4. You've saved PvP & PvE Rolls separately.
		- Use "//" followed by the notes to add text explantions or whatever in DIM.
5. You can upload them through DIM now... But DIM will overwrite the default lists with yours. 
		- This loses the more than 22k rolls already made. Including weapons & Armour.
		
How to add My Personal Rolls to the Default Database
How to Keep it Backed up AND Up to Date with the Original
6. The default is hosted on Github here: https://github.com/48klocs/dim-wish-list-sources
7. Using Github Desktop Manager:
		- Cloned into folder ../Dropbox/Tools/Gaming/Destiny Item Manager/dim-wish-list-sources
8. In order to backup my own changes I made a fork of the original that I can push and pull from.
		- In GDM in Bottom-Left click prompt to fork next to "commit to master" button
		- With fork made, click dropdown "current branch" and select "master", then leave and hit "Fetch origin" button on right.
		- Drop down previous and there should be a second "upstream" branch.
9. To pull changes from the upstream:
		- Drop down current branch->select "choose a branch to merge with master"-> select upstream option.
10. Remember to push changes to your own fork whenever you make them to keep them safe and the origin up to date
11. Note that all the Rolls from the Mercule & Panda files are already added to the voltrons
12. Now make your own by copying choosy then pasting your adds to the bottom.
13. Commit & push to fork. 
		- Find+Copy Custom List Github URL (Raw Form).
		- Paste/Replace Wishlist Source URL on DIM.
		- Update Wish List Source.
14. Done!
