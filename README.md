# dim-wish-list-sources
Source files for wish lists for [DIM (Destiny Item Manager)](https://github.com/DestinyItemManager). Some helper tools to massage things too.

This is really just a repository for generated DIM wish lists - for documentation on what they are and how to format them, [go to DIM's documentation on the matter](https://github.com/DestinyItemManager/DIM/blob/master/docs/COMMUNITY_CURATIONS.md).

If you're looking to build your own lists, [I have a tool that can help generate permutations for you](https://48klocs.github.io/wish-list-magic-wand/fingerwave.html) - the source for it [is here](https://github.com/48klocs/wish-list-magic-wand).

If you're a regular user, [voltron.txt is the default list that DIM loads for you](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/48klocs/dim-wish-list-sources/master/voltron.txt) and [choosy_voltron.txt is voltron with some opinionated trash rolls added in](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/48klocs/dim-wish-list-sources/master/choosy_voltron.txt).

The voltron(s) contain an extra bunch of rolls, c/o u/-seudonym- and u/zman2100 - [find those at the ShardItKeepIt community rolls repo](https://github.com/ThisIsMyPseudonym/sharditkeepit).
